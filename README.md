# RentMate

## Objectives of the Project

- To develop a badge system where users can earn badge for achievements and legitimacy by providing legal document like business registration certificate to the platform.
- To develop a monitoring system for usage of rental items that monitors equipment usage beyond agreed rental terms and push notifications accordingly. Renters can request rental extensions directly within the app if needed, allowing both the owner and renter to agree on an extended rental period with updated pricing.
- To incorporate built-in chat with canned responses and push notification features within the application to facilitate seamless communication between users and ensure timely updates regarding rental transactions, price drops, warnings, achievements etc.
- To develop a filter mechanism so that users can find products to rent easily.  Users can also "favorite" or save items theyâ€™re interested in renting for later. This could be as simple as adding a heart or bookmark icon next to listings.
